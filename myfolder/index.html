    <h3><img src=""></h3>
    <p id="left">Miyazaki went to Gakushuin University to study political science and economics because, clearly, his future in animation was written all over that degree. He graduates, takes one look at politics and numbers, and says, “Nah, I’d rather draw giant pigs and fluffy forest creatures.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="awards">
    <p id="right">Miyazaki has won more awards than you have socks, including:
    An Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for Spirited Away (2003) because, clearly, a movie about pigs and spirits was the thing missing from the Oscars.
    An Honorary Oscar (2014) for being the ultimate animation sensei.
    A Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement because if anyone deserves a gold lion, it’s the guy who makes you cry over trees and talking castles.</p>

    <ul id="left list"><li>He’s retired so often that Studio Ghibli staff now treat it like a temporary vacation.</li>
    <li>He hates CGI like your grandma hates TikTok and hand-draws most of his films because he’s Miyazaki, and he’ll do what he wants.</li>
    <li>His mascot is a giant forest spirit who’s technically a giant raccoon-rabbit hybrid, because why not?</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Hayao Miyazaki is the grandmaster of turning childhood joy into existential crises. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll wonder why you suddenly want to move into a magical castle with a moody wizard.</p>
